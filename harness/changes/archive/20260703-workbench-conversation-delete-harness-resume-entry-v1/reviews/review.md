# Review: workbench-conversation-delete-harness-resume-entry-v1

Status: approved.

## Findings

No blocking findings.

## Verification

Passed.

- Selected verification scope: Workbench read-model, sidebar UI, module boundaries, typecheck/lint/test/build, and Harness lint/encoding/reindex/evolve checks.
- Full / aggregate suites run or skipped: `npm run test:fast` run; slow/release Workbench suites not required because this change is conversation catalog/read-model/UI boundary only and does not alter scheduler/apply/close execution.
- Rationale for selected scope: the changed behavior is Workbench conversation deletion, SQLite message/tombstone handling, addressable topic projections, project-home active-work entry, and documentation boundaries.
- If an aggregate Workbench / slow suite exceeded the tool window: record timeout, split suite members run, pass/fail status, and whether the timeout is product failure or verification runtime-cost debt.

## Complexity Deletion Review

- Complexity deletion review applicable: yes for product/code/Harness-template/rule changes; docs-only wording changes may mark this not applicable.
- delete: none.
- reuse: reused WorkbenchStore, read-model topic resolvers, existing Workpad/confirmation/lazy projection owners, and existing sidebar menu plumbing.
- yagni: avoided close/abandon/cancel lifecycle UI, extra transcript summary preservation, new workflow truth, new action type, and automation permission changes.
- shrink: simpler alternative checked: hidden_topics alone was insufficient because it neither deletes transcript messages nor prevents legacy thread import; a separate deleted_topics tombstone keeps the boundary narrow.
- net: Lean already.
- Note: this is supplemental and does not replace correctness, security, source safety, validation/audit, stale-target, ToolPolicyGate, human-gate, or required coverage checks.

## Documentation Entropy Coverage

- Documentation entropy coverage applicable: yes.

## Workbench User-Surface Honesty Coverage

- Workbench user-surface honesty coverage applicable: yes.
