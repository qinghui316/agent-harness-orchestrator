# Review: main-agent-bridge-integration-acceptance-closeout-v1

Status: approved.

## Findings

No blocking findings.

## Verification

- Selected verification scope: targeted bridge/action tests plus standard product and Harness gates.
- Targeted tests:
  - `npx vitest run tests/unit/action-revalidation.test.ts tests/unit/main-agent-bridge-server.test.ts tests/unit/main-agent-step-loop.test.ts tests/unit/workbench-module-boundaries.test.ts` passed.
- Standard verification:
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run test:fast` passed.
  - `npm run build` passed with the existing Vite chunk-size warning.
- Harness verification:
  - `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/lint-ecl.ps1` passed.
  - `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/lint-encoding.ps1` passed.
  - `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/harness-change.ps1 reindex` passed.
  - `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/harness-evolve.ps1 check` passed; no pending evolution, 4 archived changes since last completion.
- Full / aggregate suites run or skipped: `test:fast` and `build` were run; full `npm run test` and slow Workbench suites skipped because this change only adds bridge acceptance coverage and docs, with no UI/runtime execution changes.
- Rationale for selected scope: targeted tests cover workflow bridge revalidation, approval server path, core bridge fail-closed semantics, and module-boundary regressions. Standard gates cover type/lint/build and broad fast regression.
- If an aggregate Workbench / slow suite exceeded the tool window: record timeout, split suite members run, pass/fail status, and whether the timeout is product failure or verification runtime-cost debt.

## Complexity Deletion Review

- Complexity deletion review applicable: yes for product/code/Harness-template/rule changes; docs-only wording changes may mark this not applicable.
- delete: none.
- reuse: existing `assessMainAgentActionBridge`, workflow action revalidation, and approval route bridge checks.
- yagni: avoided a new server-side guard helper, new bridge owner, UI surface, and action type.
- shrink: subagent review found the broad hardening plan repeated completed work, so the change was shrunk to acceptance tests and handoff docs.
- net: Lean already.
- Note: this is supplemental and does not replace correctness, security, source safety, validation/audit, stale-target, ToolPolicyGate, human-gate, or required coverage checks.

## Acceptance Feedback
