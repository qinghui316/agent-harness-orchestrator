This file is the short resume point. Architecture Growth Control / Core Mechanism Reuse is now documented as a development constraint and local change templates require future structured changes to plan and review reuse of shared mechanisms. Phase 12W remains the latest product behavior baseline after adding read-only observation report evidence for deterministic, human-gated canonical docs/stable-memory patch application results.

Current plan-level roadmap context is preserved in `docs/CURRENT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md`. Historical detail belongs in archived summaries and `harness/changes/INDEX.json`.

## Current Baseline

The product baseline is post-Phase-12W with no active product change and no pending Harness evolution. Goal Loop controlled-loop state, routing posture, and SchedulerRun terminal handoff evidence remain non-executing evidence only. SchedulerRun terminal Workpad completion and blocked-closeout cards remain read-only evidence and do not authorize loop/full-executor/dispatch/slot/source/apply/close/merge/Harness-evolution behavior.

Product-level maintenance writes candidate lifecycle-resolution evidence, canonical update proposal evidence, human-gated canonical update decision records, canonical patch proposal evidence, human-gated canonical patch application follow-up records, read-only application manifest/readiness evidence, Phase 12U target-descriptor evidence, Phase 12V human-gated canonical docs/stable-memory application result evidence, and Phase 12W read-only observation report evidence while still forbidding automatic canonical rewrites.

Phase 12A remains the future controlled Scheduler/parallel loop design boundary. Current runtime remains single-gate staged until a later accepted ECL change implements and verifies loop behavior.

## Next Resume Point

Resume the next structured product slice from `docs/CURRENT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md`. Start with the Architecture Growth Control register before opening another evidence-only or descriptor-only phase; the first source convergence candidate is the maintenance / canonical patch chain. Keep `README.md` unrelated and untracked unless the user explicitly asks to include it.

## Verification Commands

Harness/documentation verification:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/lint-ecl.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/lint-encoding.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/harness-change.ps1 reindex
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/harness-change.ps1 status
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/harness-evolve.ps1 check
```

Product verification when product code changes:

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:fast
npm run build
npm run test:integration
npm run test:workbench
```

## Archive Lookup

Use `harness/changes/INDEX.json` for the generated archive list. Start with archived `summary.md` files; open specs, plans, reviews, or source only when the current task needs that evidence.
